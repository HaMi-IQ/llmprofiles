# Combined Training Data

This directory contains combined and cross-profile training datasets for the LLM profiles system.

## Purpose

Combined training data enables:

- **Cross-profile learning** - Understanding relationships between different profile types
- **Integrated scenarios** - Real-world use cases involving multiple profiles
- **Advanced training** - Complex examples that combine multiple profile features
- **Performance optimization** - Training on diverse, realistic data combinations

## Contents

- **Multi-profile examples** - Data that spans multiple profile types
- **Integration scenarios** - Common combinations and workflows
- **Cross-validation data** - Training data for relationship validation
- **Performance datasets** - Large, complex training examples
- **Edge case combinations** - Complex scenarios and boundary conditions

## Status

ðŸš§ **Under Development** - This directory is being populated with comprehensive combined training data.

## Usage

Combined training data is used for:

- Advanced model training
- Integration testing
- Performance benchmarking
- Cross-profile validation
- Real-world scenario simulation

## Data Structure

Each combined dataset includes:

- **Profile combinations** - Which profiles are involved
- **Relationship mappings** - How profiles connect and interact
- **Validation rules** - Cross-profile constraints and requirements
- **Example outputs** - Expected results and transformations

## Contributing

When adding new combined training data:

1. Clearly document the profile relationships
2. Include validation rules and constraints
3. Provide comprehensive examples
4. Add tests for the combined scenarios
5. Update this README with new additions
