Each profile includes JSON-LD context definitions with SKOS and SHACL constraints, output schemas for structured data extraction, best practices and usage guidelines, and validation rules for quality assurance. By implementing these profiles, content creators can ensure their structured data is optimized for AI processing and search engine visibility.",
